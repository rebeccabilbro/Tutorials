    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs that represent real-world problem spaces (in terms of objects, functions, classes, attributes, methods, and inheritance). As Allen Downey explains in __Think Python__, in object-oriented programming, we shift away from framing the *function* as the active agent and toward seeing the *object* as the active agent (http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython018.html).\n",
